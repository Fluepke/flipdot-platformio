# flipdot-platformio
A library for controlling flip-dots

This is a software library for controlling flipdots using [this board](https://github.com/nerdmanufaktur/flipdot/tree/master/Schematics%20and%20PCB)
It is based on reverse engineering flipdot panels bought from the BVG.

In case you need flipdots please contact me via DM.
